# The Influences and Impacts of Computing and Society

This educational plan is a stand-alone unit to be incorporated into a high school computer science course.  The course, Computer Science, is a year-long course for students in grades 10 through 12.  Computer Science meets the current California Computer Science Standards with the major topics of: Digital Citizenship, Cryptography & Encryption, Networks & the Internet, and Programming.  This unit is best placed early in the course as students will benefit by having a common lens with which to approach and analyze later topics.  There is, however, flexibility with the sequencing of this unit as no other topics directly rely on the content as prior knowledge.  The goal of this plan is to provide a structured outline and resources that other educators may use in the high school setting.



## The Plan, Part 1: The Prior and Current Influences Between Computing and Society

### Learning Objectives

Primarily focusing on Inclusion within Computing, students will gain an understanding of these influences by discussing, questioning, critiquing and evaluating information and data.  Specifically, students will examine:
  * Diversity in Computing
  * The Benefits of Diversity
  * Methods of Broadening Participation

### Learning Activities

#### Investigation 1

Step 1  
"Question to Ponder": When thinking about people working in computing and technology jobs, who do you think of?

  * Students are provided with the question prompt and will write a response on a provided page.  As needed, students may be given assistance by suggesting that they describe people working in computing and tech by:
    * what they look like - their likely ethnicity, gender, etc.
    * what their likely educational background is
    * 
  * Students either share their repsone with the class or if the teacher thinks that anonymity is more appropriate given the classroom and/or school culture, then the responses will be collected with the teacher sharing them.
  * Students discuss similarities and differences in the responses and identify common themes or trends.

Step 2  
Students are given the article XXXXX and are asked to silently read it

  * Students are then presented with 

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.
