# The Influences and Impacts of Computing and Society

This educational plan is a stand-alone unit to be incorporated into a high school computer science course.  The course, Computer Science, is a year-long course for students in grades 10 through 12.  Computer Science meets the current California Computer Science Standards with the major topics of: Digital Citizenship, Cryptography & Encryption, Networks & the Internet, and Programming.  This unit is best placed early in the course as students will benefit by having a common lens with which to approach and analyze later topics.  There is, however, flexibility with the sequencing of this unit as no other topics directly rely on the content as prior knowledge.  The goal of this plan is to provide a structured outline and resources that other educators may use in the high school setting.



## The Plan, Part 1: The Prior and Current Influences Between Computing and Society

### Learning Objectives

Primarily focusing on Inclusion within Computing, students will gain an understanding of these influences by discussing, questioning, critiquing and evaluating information and data.  Specifically, students will examine:
  * Diversity in Computing
  * The Benefits of Diversity
  * Broadening Participation

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
