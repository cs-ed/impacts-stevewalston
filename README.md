# The Influences and Impacts of Computing and Society

This educational plan is a stand-alone unit to be incorporated into a high school computer science course.  The course, Computer Science, is a year-long course for students in grades 10 through 12.  Computer Science meets the current California Computer Science Standards with the major topics of: Digital Citizenship, Cryptography & Encryption, Networks & the Internet, and Programming.  This unit is best placed early in the course as students will benefit by having a common lens with which to approach and analyze later topics.  There is, however, flexibility with the sequencing of this unit as no other topics directly rely on the content as prior knowledge.  The goal of this plan is to provide a structured outline and digital resources that other educators may use in the high school setting.



## The Plan, Part 1: The Prior and Current Influences Between Computing and Society

### Learning Objectives

Primarily focusing on Inclusion within Computing, students will gain an understanding of how different societal influences/actions affect inclusion.  Students will gain the perspective to identify and address inclusion by discussing, questioning, comparing and critiquing information and data.  Specifically, students will examine:
  * Diversity in Computing
  * The Benefits of Diversity
  * Methods of Broadening Participation  

As a result of these examinations, students will suggest/create methods to broaden inclusion in computing.

### Learning Activities

#### Investigation 1
 
Question to Ponder: "When thinking about people working in computing and technology jobs, who do you think of?"

Step 1  
  * Students are provided with the question prompt above and will write a response on a provided page* (the reference to 'pages' throughout includes print or digital).  As needed, students may be given assistance by suggesting that they describe people working in computing and tech by:
    * what they look like, that is their likely ethnicity, gender, age range, etc.
    * what their likely educational background is, etc.
  * Students either share their repsone with the class or if the teacher thinks that anonymity is more appropriate given the classroom and/or school culture, then the responses will be collected, with the teacher sharing them anonymously.  Writing/organizing the responses on a whiteboard or projected screen will be beneficial for analysis by students.
  * As a class, students discuss similarities and differences in the responses and identify common themes and/or trends.

Step 2  
  * Depending on the common themes and/or trends in the student responses in Step 1,students are asked to read a combination of these articles:
    * [Women and Minorities in Tech, By the Numbers](https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/)
    * [Why is Computer Science Unpopular Among Women?](https://today.ttu.edu/posts/2021/09/Stories/why-is-computer-science-unpopular-among-women)
    * [Black, Latino People Are Being Left Out of the Tech Workforce](https://www.govtech.com/workforce/black-latino-people-are-being-left-out-of-the-tech-workforce.html)
    * [More high schools offer computer science courses, but enrollment disparities persist](https://www.k12dive.com/news/report-more-high-schools-offer-computer-science-courses-but-enrollment-di/609890/)
  * After the readings are finished, students are provided with the question prompt, "How accurate were both your individual and the class descriptions of people working in computing and technology?".  Students are given time to write a response on a provided page.
  * As a follow-up, students are asked to write their response(s) to the question prompt, "What are any surprises from, or what is anything new you gained from the articles?" on the same page as above.
  * Students are encouraged to share their take-aways with the class and then are given time to record any additional thoughts.

#### Investigation 2

Question to Ponder: "What are the impacts of a lack of inclusion/diversity in computing ... or any field for that matter?"

  * Students read:
    * [Why does diversity and inclusion matter in tech?](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/about/diversity-engineering-computer-science/diversity-inclusion-blogs/why-does-diversity-and)
    * [Why Creating a Diverse Workforce Matters](https://uncf.org/the-latest/why-creating-a-diverse-workforce-matters)
    * [Why Workplace Diversity Matters](https://aofund.org/resource/why-workplace-diversity-matters/)
  * As a class, students are encouraged to share their reactions to the readings.
  * Individually, students record at least one take-away from the readings on a provided page.
 

#### Investigation 3

Question to Ponder: "How can a lack of inclusion/diversity in computing be addressed?"

  * Building upon the reading and take-away(s) in Investigation 2 and the information in Investigation 1, students select one category from a list such as:
    * Educational Policy
    * Motivational Poster
    * Outreach Project or Program
    * (Other ?)  
  * Students working in pairs, or individually if necessary, will create a "product" that addresses inclusion/diverstiy.  It is not realistic that a single policy, poster, etc. can be the comprehensive solution.  Rather, students will be directed to focus on one aspect of the larger issue of inclusion.  Students are encouraged to think in positive terms, keeping the goal of broadening or celebrating participation as a central theme.   Suggestions to share as possible "products" are:
    * A program to increase inclusion of Native students
    * A policy to foster participation of economically disadvantaged or rural students
    * An poster that highlights the contributions or accomplishments in computing by one or more diverse groups
  * At the completion of the "product" creation, students will share what they have created with the class.

### Assessment

Assessment will be accomplished through two methods.  The first is the collection, review and return of the students' response pages.  The second is the creation and sharing of the "product" that students created to address inclusion.  The expectation is that through the successful completion of the actions and activities of these investigations, students will fulfill the learning objectives.


## The Plan, Part 2: The Positive and Negative Impacts of Computing

### Learning Objectives and Acknowlements

Primarily focusing on Positive and Negative Impacts of Computing, students will gain an understanding of these impacts and effects by examining, discussing and evaluating recent news pieces.  Specifially, students will examine:
  * Examples of Negative/Harmful Effects that are results of computing
  * Examples of Positive/Helpful Effects that are results of computing  

As a result of these examinations, students will be informed and better prepared to be proactive in anticipating, addressing and preventing negative impacts of computing in their futures.  

I would like to acknowledge my fellow students in the CSU Chico, Spring 2022 CSED 511 course for sharing the articles included in these explorations.  Identifying age-appropriate materials and offering their rationale for the choices is a time-consuming task and I am grateful for their energies and thoughtfulness.

### Learning Activities

#### Investigation 1

Exploration: The harmful impacts of computing

  * To begin the exploration, all students will read the same article selected by the teacher.  When the reading is completed, the teacher will lead/encourage a class discussion as to what the harmful impact was.  The teacher can then model what a written response could look like.
  * Students will then be assigned a few of these articles to read:
    * [What Is the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency?](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-the-environmental-impact-of-cryptocurrency)

    * [How Technology is Warping Your Memory](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/technology-changes-memory_n_4414778)
  * For each article read, students will record their response, in the style modeled by the teacher, primarily focusing on:
    * What the impact was
    * What led to the impact
    * What could have been done to prevent the impact
    * Whether a lack of diversity had a role in the impact

#### Investigation 2

Exploration: The helpful impacts of computing

  * Similar to the beginning of Investigation 1, all students will read the same article selected by the teacher.  When the reading is completed, the teacher will lead/encourage a class discussion as to what the helpful impact was.  The teacher can then model what a written response could look like.
  * Students will then be assigned a few of these articles to read:
    * [The Exponential Power of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/magazine/fall-2016/the-exponential-power-of-computer-science.html)
    * [Stanford students put computer science skills to social good](https://news.stanford.edu/2015/11/19/cs-for-good-111915/)

  * For each article read, students will record their response, in the style modeled by the teacher, primarily focusing on:
    * What the impact was
    * What led to (facilitated) the impact
    * Whether inclusion/diversity had a role in the impact
    * What might a next step (or steps) be to extend the helpful impact

### Assessment

The primary assessment will be accomplished through the collection, review and return of the students' response pages.  The expectation is that through the successful completion of the actions of these explorations, students will fulfill the learning objectives. An extenstion to these explorations, and a second assessment of student understanding, is to have each student find an addtional example of both harmful and helpful impacts.  Students will submit the titles of the articles, the urls, and their responses to the same prompts as done in both of the explorations.


## Outcomes

The overarching goal of this plan is to give students the time and resources to analyze, discuss and question:
  * The current state of diversity in computing
  * The benefits of diversity in computing
  * The impacts of computing, both positive and negative
The diffent investigations in this plan are interrelated to the extent that students have opportunities to see that nothing happens in isolation.  For example, exploring harmful impacts of computing via facial recognition softwares lets students see that participation by a broader, more diverse group could have questioned and remedied intial assumptions that were made in creating the software.
