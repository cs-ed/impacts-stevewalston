# The Influences and Impacts of Computing and Society

This educational plan is a stand-alone unit to be incorporated into a high school computer science course.  The course, Computer Science, is a year-long course for students in grades 10 through 12.  Computer Science meets the current California Computer Science Standards with the major topics of: Digital Citizenship, Cryptography & Encryption, Networks & the Internet, and Programming.  This unit is best placed early in the course as students will benefit by having a common lens with which to approach and analyze later topics.  There is, however, flexibility with the sequencing of this unit as no other topics directly rely on the content as prior knowledge.  The goal of this plan is to provide a structured outline and digital resources that other educators may use in the high school setting.



## The Plan, Part 1: The Prior and Current Influences Between Computing and Society

### Learning Objectives

Primarily focusing on Inclusion within Computing, students will gain an understanding of how different societal influences/actions affect inclusion.  Students will gain the perspective to identify and address inclusion by discussing, questioning, comparing, critiquing information and data.  Specifically, students will examine:
  * Diversity in Computing
  * The Benefits of Diversity
  * Methods of Broadening Participation  

As a result of these examinations, students will suggest/create methods to address inclusion.

### Learning Activities

#### Investigation 1
 
Question to Ponder: "When thinking about people working in computing and technology jobs, who do you think of?"

Step 1  
  * Students are provided with the question prompt above and will write a response on a provided page.  As needed, students may be given assistance by suggesting that they describe people working in computing and tech by:
    * what they look like - their likely ethnicity, gender, etc.
    * what their likely educational background is
  * Students either share their repsone with the class or if the teacher thinks that anonymity is more appropriate given the classroom and/or school culture, then the responses will be collected with the teacher sharing them.  Writing/organizing the responses on a whiteboard or projected screen will be beneficial for analysis by students.
  * As a class, students discuss similarities and differences in the responses and identify common themes and/or trends.

Step 2  
  * Students are asked to read the articles:
    * [Women and Minorities in Tech, By the Numbers](https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/)
    * [Why is Computer Science Unpopular Among Women?](https://today.ttu.edu/posts/2021/09/Stories/why-is-computer-science-unpopular-among-women)
    * [Black, Latino People Are Being Left Out of the Tech Workforce](https://www.govtech.com/workforce/black-latino-people-are-being-left-out-of-the-tech-workforce.html)
  * After the readings are finished, students are provided with the question prompt, "How accurate were both your individual and the class descriptions of people working in computing and technology?".  Students are given time to write a response on a provided page.
  * As a follow-up, students can be asked or volunteer to share their responses to the question prompt, "What are any surprises from, or what is anything new you gained from the articles?"
  * Students are given time to record their take-aways on the page provided earlier.

#### Investigation 2

Question to Ponder: "What are the impacts of a lack of inclusion/diversity in computing ... or any field for that matter?"

Step 1  
  * Students read:
    * [Why does diversity and inclusion matter in tech?](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/about/diversity-engineering-computer-science/diversity-inclusion-blogs/why-does-diversity-and)
    * [Why Creating a Diverse Workforce Matters](https://uncf.org/the-latest/why-creating-a-diverse-workforce-matters)
    * [Why Workplace Diversity Matters](https://aofund.org/resource/why-workplace-diversity-matters/)
  * As a class, students share their reactions to the readings.
 

#### Investigation 3

Question to Ponder: "How can a lack of inclusion/diversity in computing be addressed?"

Step 1  
  * Building upon the information in Investigation 2, students select one category from a list such as:
    * Educational Policies
    * Advertising Campaign
    * Outreach Project
    * (Other)  
  * Students working in pairs, or individually if necessary, to create a "product" that addresses inclusion/diverstiy.  It is not realistic that a single policy, advertisement, etc. can be the comprehensive solution.  Rather, students will be directed to focus on one aspect of the larger issue such as focusing on:
    * A method to increase inclusion rates of Native students
    * A method to increase inclusion rates of students from Rural locales
    * An advertisement that highlights the contributions in computing by diverse groups/persons
  * At the completion of the "product" creation, students will share their work with the class.

### Assessment

Assessment will be accomplished through two methods.  The first is the collection, review and return of the students' response pages.  The second is the creation and sharing of the "product" that students created to address inclusion.  The expectation is that through the successful completion of the actions and activities of these investigations, students will fulfill the learning objectives.


## The Plan, Part 2: The Positive and Negative Impacts of Computing

### Learning Objectives

Primarily focusing on Positive and Negative Impacts of Computing, students will gain an understanding of these impacts and effects by examining, discussing and evaluating recent news pieces.  Specifially, students will examine:
  * Examples of Hurtful/Negative Effects that are results of computing
  * Examples of Helpful/Positive Effects that are results of computing  

As a result of these examinations, students will be better prepared to be proactive in regards to the role they have in addressing/preventing negative impacts of computing in the future.

## Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
